Java implementation for Public API of http://www.namecheap.com/. Initial version contains only main operations:
- get domains list
- check domain (is it free for registration)
- add domain (with records)
- update domain records
- get provider TLDs list
- renew domain for number of years
- reactivate domain
- lock/unlock domain

/jar direcory contains jar and properties file. This file must be filled with appropriate settings from http://www.namecheap.com/ user account api acces section, and added to classpath for production.

Some operations depends on domains from your account (ie. "renew domain", "lock domain", etc.) and therefore unit tests may fail by default. So it's recommended to build project skipping them:
mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
